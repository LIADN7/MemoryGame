### The memory game, Test your memory with a memory game!

## Rules:

 The player is given a board consisting of a variety of pictures.

 At the start, all pictures are folded (flipped, so the picture itself will be invisible).

 Each turn, the player pick 2 pictures to flip.

 If he fails - the current pictures get flipped again to be invisible and a point loss.

 If he succeeds (player found 2 of a kind) - the current pictures remain unfolded (visible).

 If the player (player found 2 of a kind) - the current pictures remain unfolded (visible) and two random adjusted tiles swap position with each other.

 To help the player, The player can click the "help" icon once in the game to help him reveal 2 cards, 
 but be careful because the "help" action will result in a point loss.
